# phase2-proeject

This project is intended to serve as my second project for the FlatIron school Bootcamp.

## Installation
Install this library for router:

'''bash npm install react-router-dom'''

## Starting Project
In order to start the project, cd into phase-2-project directory.

In order to run it open a terminal and use this command:
'''bash json-server --watch db.json'''

This will host the json database for the applicaiton.
Next use this command in a seperate terminal:
'''bash npm start'''

It will prompt to run on a different port, continue with entering 'y'. It is likely to run on port 3001


## Info

The project is comprised of three pages, "Home", "About", and "Mystery". The naming of these are largely irrelevant. Feel free to navigate and add items into the DB. This can be achieved by simply inputting information into the form.

The project will only make a single get request, unless refreshed.
